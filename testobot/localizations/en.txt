greetings=Hi! I can help you to make a good-looking meta snapshot!
Type /make_snapshot to jump right in or /help to get help. What a coincidence!;
help=To change language just send 'ru' or 'en'
/help shows you this message
/usage_example sends you commands that you can just forward back here and get your first meta snapshot in few seconds
/make_snapshot creates the new meta snapshot instance. You can't create snapshots until you have published or discarded the previous one
Once you've created a new snapshot, send the title which will be shown on top of it
/add_tier adds a new tier. Be sure to provide its name in the next message

If you already added a tier, just send deck links with short description
(for example, https://www.playgwent.com/en/decks/guides/355316 Kiki kekker)
You can add as many tiers and decks as you want, but I recommend you to have about 16 decks at all and split them into tiers of rational size
/preview_text sends you text version of your snapshot
/preview_photo sends you picture of your snapshot
/sign signs your snapshot, your username wil be displayed on a final picture (signed by default)
/unsign unsigns your snapshot if you want to remain anonymous
/publish saves the results, sends you all that you've done (in fact /preview_text and /preview_photo) and releases snapshot slot for future use
/discard deletes everything that you've done and releases snapshot slot for future use. Be careful.

/future can show you everything I want to implement. This is my todo-list

And of course can always contact me (developer) - I am @sladkokotikov ‚ù§Ô∏è;
